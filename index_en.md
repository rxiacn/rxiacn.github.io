## About Me
I am a full professor at School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Nanjing University. I received my Ph.D degree at National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011, under the supervision of Prof. Chengqing Zong. My research fields include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, Affective Computing, and Large Language Models.

Currently, I am interested in the following topics: sentiment analysis and opinion mining, information extraction and knowledge graph, human-machine interaction and dialogue system, social media analysis, multimodal machine learning, commonsense knowledge reasoning, large language model, financial NLP, etc.
